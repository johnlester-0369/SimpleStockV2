/**
 * AdminPublicRoute guard component
 *
 * Mirrors PublicRoute for the user portal but targets the admin auth context.
 * Redirects authenticated admins away from /admin (login page) to the dashboard
 * so revisiting the login URL mid-session doesn't flash the form.
 *
 * The role check is a defence-in-depth measure — the adminAuth server hook already
 * enforces admin-only sessions, but we double-check client-side so no non-admin
 * session can accidentally bypass to the dashboard.
 *
 * The user portal's better-auth.session_token is never inspected here;
 * both session systems are fully independent.
